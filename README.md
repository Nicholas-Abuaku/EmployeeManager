# EmployeeManager
Employee Management WebApp

## Setup
You will need to create a MySQL database called "springbootwebapp"
Next, in src/main/resources/application.properties configure the following:
spring.datasource.username=yourMySQLUsername
spring.datasource.password=yourMySQLPassword
server.port=8383 (change server.port to whatever port you want or keep it the same.)
